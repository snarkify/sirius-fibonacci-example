# Sirius Fibonacci Example

Welcome to the `sirius-fibonacci-example` repository, an example designed to demonstrate the application of the [**Sirius**](https://github.com/snarkify/sirius/) framework for Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC).

## Introduction

This repository provides a practical example that implements a custom StepCircuit to calculate Fibonacci numbers over multiple folding steps. The example is designed to help developers understand the configuration and synthesis of custom circuits in the Sirius framework, focusing on iterative arithmetic operations.

## Understanding the Fibonacci StepCircuit

### What Does the Fibonacci StepCircuit Do?

The `FibonacciCircuit` in this example is designed to compute elements of the Fibonacci sequence across multiple folding steps. Here's a detailed breakdown of its operation:

- Initialization: The circuit begins with two initial values, typically 0 and 1, which represent the first two Fibonacci numbers.

- Iteration: The circuit then iteratively computes the next Fibonacci number by summing the two preceding numbers. This process is repeated for a specified number of steps within the circuit.

- Output: The circuit outputs a pair of Fibonacci numbers that result from the specified number of iterations. For example, if the circuit is configured to compute the sequence for 10 steps, the output will be the 9th and 10th Fibonacci numbers.

#### Key Concepts

- FibonacciIter Structure: A custom iterator structure that generates Fibonacci numbers by repeatedly summing the previous two numbers.

- Custom Gates: The circuit utilizes a custom gate that enforces the relationship $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n$ within the folding steps. This gate ensures that each step of the computation correctly adheres to the Fibonacci sequence.

- Selectors and Advice Columns: The configuration includes advice columns to store the Fibonacci numbers and a selector to control the execution of the addition gate.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Rust

If you haven't already installed Rust, you can do so by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Rustup will set up your environment with the latest stable Rust compiler and Cargo, Rust's package manager.

To install Rust, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, make sure your Rust toolchain is up-to-date:

```bash
rustup update
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the sirius-quickstart repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sirius-fibonacci-example.git
cd sirius-fibonacci-example
```

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

- src/: Contains the source code for the example.
- Cargo.toml: The Cargo configuration file, listing dependencies and metadata for the project.

## Running the Example

### 1. First Run

To run the example for the first time, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

This will compile the project in release mode, which is optimized for speed. During this initial run, the commitment keys for the BN256 and Grumpkin curves will be generated and cached. This process may take some time, so running in release mode ensures it completes as quickly as possible.

### 2. Subsequent Runs
For subsequent runs, you can use the following command without the --release flag:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will reuse the previously generated commitment keys, so the process will be faster, and thereâ€™s no need to recompile in release mode unless you're making significant changes or need the performance optimization again.

### 3. Expected Output
When the example runs successfully, you should see output indicating that the folding steps were executed and verified successfully:

```text
start setup primary commitment key: bn256
start setup secondary commitment key: grumpkin
ivc created
folding step 1 was successful
folding step 2 was successful
folding step 3 was successful
folding step 4 was successful
folding step 5 was successful
verification successful
success
```

## Understanding the Example
This example demonstrates the following key concepts of the Sirius framework:

- StepCircuit: A trait representing the circuit for each step in the IVC. In this example, the circuit performs an identity operation.
- Commitment Keys: Setup for the primary and secondary circuits, using BN256 and Grumpkin elliptic curves.
- Folding Steps: Execution of multiple folding steps, each represented by an invocation of the fold_step function.

For more detailed explanations, please refer to the main [Sirius documentation](https://docs.snarkify.io/sirius-folding/quickstart).

## Next Steps
After understanding this Fibonacci example, you can explore more complex circuits and further customize your IVC setup:

- Extend the Fibonacci Circuit: Modify the circuit to compute more elements or implement a different arithmetic sequence.
- Experiment with Parameters: Adjust the number of folding steps or change the initial conditions of the sequence.
- Explore Advanced Features: Delve into the Sirius main repository for more complex features such as custom gates, multi-circuit setups, and performance optimizations.
